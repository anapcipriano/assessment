  Project background: Pesticide exposure is associated with insect pollinator declines, and it may have an impact on bees behaviour, health and colony development. The study exposed 20 bumblebee colonies to neonicotinoid clothianidin for 5 weeks, establishing a realistic field setting. Using this dataset. In general, the article showed that the clothianidin, contrary to other neonicotinoids pesticides, caused subtle foraging changes in the colonies and a significant reduction in adult and sexual bumbleebes at the end of the treatment. I wanted to explore the articles' dataset containing the bee groups, such as eggs, pupae, larval, queen, worker, male, and gyne, developing a python project to implement some analysis and explore the impact of the treatment on these groups. This project can be applied to projects with similar scopes, and I intend to use this methodology in my PhD project since I will study the effect of pesticides on social bees. Furthermore, adapting this project to similar data frames is interesting since pesticides are widely used and can affect bees' health and, consequently, their pollination services.
